projectContent:
  - "Designed and developed a machine learning-powered web application to detect fake news, leveraging Passive Aggressive (89% accuracy) and Naive Bayes (93% accuracy) classifiers trained on a Kaggle dataset. Integrated the ML models seamlessly with a Python Flask backend for smooth and efficient predictions."
  - "Built a minimal, responsive UI for real-time testing of news articles, enabling quick and accurate determination of authenticity."
features:
  - "ML-based fake vs real news classification"
  - "Real-time predictions on custom input"
  - "Trained on large Kaggle dataset"
  - "Automatic selection of highest accuracy model"
  - "Python Flask backend with ML integration"
  - "Minimal, responsive UI for testing"
